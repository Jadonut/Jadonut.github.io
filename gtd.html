								<h2>About:</h2>
								Graffiti Tower Defense is a 3D tower defense game built with a custom C++ engine. Waves of enemy paint drops walk down
								a path towards your wall of art that you must defend! This game features over 10 different towers, 3 enemy types,
								and 5 levels. This game was made as a final project for Full Sail University.

									<h3>Text implementation with DirectWrite</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/GTD_text.png" alt="" /></span>
									For rendering text on the screen, I decided to utilize DirectWrite, a text layout rendering API by Microsoft.
									To draw the text onto the raster target, I used Direct2D and drew on the same backbuffer as the 3D rendered objects.
									I created a Text class that allows the changing of the font, font size, text color, and text style at runtime.
									The picture to the right showcases the HUD, which is something I created with use of my text class and it showcases
									text being rendering which updates during the game. One of the most important features of this text API is that the
									font size can be changed to any size at compile/runtime.
									<br /><br />

									<b>Highlights:</b>
									<br />
									<ul>
										<li>Customizable font, color, and text style</li>
										<li>Renders text onto same backbuffer as 3D rendered objects</li>
										<li>Vector graphics API allows any font size at compile/runtime</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

									<h3>GameObject system</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/GameObjectSystem.png" alt="" /></span>
									Each object in the game is a "GameObject" with multiple components. I built this system,
									which follows Unity's GameObject system closely, to control how objects are rendered and how
									the general game loop is ran. Each object can have multiple components
									such as Animator, MeshRenderer, Collider, Material, and Lights. When GameObjects get deleted,
									they delete all dynamic memory they have and get removed from a GameObject hierarchy. I personally
									created many of the components like the Animator, MeshRenderer, PointLight, DirectionalLight, and Material.

									<h3>3D meshes, textures, animations, and sprites</h3>

									I created nearly all the 3D meshes, textures, animations, and sprites for the game
									using Blender and Photoshop. Although the project was made to learn game development,
									assets were needed to make the game visually complete. Therefore, along with programming
									the C++ engine and designing the game, I also modeled and drew assets for the game.
									I have a history of making art, so creating the assets was something I happily accepted
									as a job. As well as creating the animations, I also skinned the 3D models in a pixel shader.

									<h3>Lighting</h3>

									</div>

									Graffiti Tower Defense utilizes two different lights: Point and Directional. I created
									both of these lights as components to our GameObjects. If a developer wanted to add
									a point or directional light, they would simply have to add it as a component to a
									GameObject. Afterwards, they could adjust the color, intensity, and radius of the light.
									In the Render loop of our game, I check each existing GameObject for lights and add their
									data to a lighting constant buffer. In the standard pixel shader, lighting gets rendered
									using the constant buffer.
