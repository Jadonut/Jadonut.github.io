								<!-- About -->
								<h2>About:</h2>
								Oakmar is a 3D mobile adventure game made with Unity. You must control Oakmar, a small acorn, to complete puzzles and
								avoid obstacles to reach a glowing treesap, which completes the level. Each level has a couple collecatbles the player
								can obtain to unlock other areas of the game. After each level, the player is taken to a 3D level select where they can
								move around to choose a level to play (similar to Super Mario World). There are 15 levels, 10+ minigames, and a final boss.

									<h3>Text implementation with DirectWrite</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/GTD/GTD_text.png" alt="" /></span>
									For rendering text on the screen, I decided to utilize DirectWrite, a text layout rendering API by Microsoft.
									To draw the text onto the raster target, I used Direct2D and drew on the same backbuffer as the 3D rendered objects.
									I created a Text class that allows the changing of the font, font size, text color, and text style at runtime.
									The picture to the right showcases the HUD, which is something I created with use of my text class and it showcases
									text being rendering which updates during the game. One of the most important features of this text API is that the
									font size can be changed to any size at compile/runtime.
									<br /><br />

									<b>Highlights:</b>
									<br />
									<ul>
										<li>Customizable font, color, and text style</li>
										<li>Renders text onto same backbuffer as 3D rendered objects</li>
										<li>Vector graphics API allows any font size at compile/runtime</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<br />

									<h3>GameObject system</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/GTD/GameObjectSystem.png" alt="" /></span>
									Each object in the game is a "GameObject" with multiple components. I built this system,
									which follows Unity's GameObject system closely, to control how objects are rendered and how
									the general game loop is ran. Each object can have multiple components
									such as Animator, MeshRenderer, Collider, Material, and Lights. When GameObjects get deleted,
									they delete all dynamic memory they have and get removed from a GameObject hierarchy. I personally
									created many of the components like the Animator, MeshRenderer, PointLight, DirectionalLight, and Material.
								</p>

								<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

									<h3>3D meshes, textures, animations, and sprites</h3>

											<source src="videos/GTD_meshClip.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
										</video>
									</div>

									I created nearly all the 3D meshes, textures, animations, and sprites for the game
									using Blender and Photoshop. As well as creating the animations, I also skinned the 3D
									models in a pixel shader. Although the project was made to learn game development,
									assets were needed to make the game visually complete. Therefore, along with programming
									the C++ engine and designing the game, I also modeled and drew assets for the game.
									I have a history of making art, so creating the assets was something I happily accepted
									as a job.

									<h3>Lighting</h3>

									<div class="image left">
										<video width="300" height="300" muted autoplay loop preload="auto">
											<source src="videos/GTD_lighting.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
										</video>
									</div>

									Graffiti Tower Defense utilizes two different lights: Point and Directional. I created
									both of these lights as components to our GameObjects. If a developer wanted to add
									a point or directional light, they would simply have to add it as a component to a
									GameObject. Afterwards, they could adjust the color, intensity, and radius of the light.
									In the Render loop of our game, I check each existing GameObject for lights and add their
									data to a lighting constant buffer. In the standard pixel shader, lighting gets rendered
									using the constant buffer.
								</p>

								<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

								<p>
									<h3>Shop System</h3>

									<div class="image right">
										<video width="400" height="360" muted autoplay loop preload="auto">
											<source src="videos/GTD_shop.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
										</video>
									</div>

									One of the biggest components of Graffiti Tower Defense is the shop system. Killing
									enemies will give the player money, and the only place to spend that money is the
									shop. This makes the focus and progression of the game be unlocking new towers and
									upgrading current towers. I created the buying/selling features of the shop, as well
									as showing the tower radius.
